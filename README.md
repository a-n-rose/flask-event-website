# flask-event-website
This is the template I built for my husband and my wedding. Pages include: registration/login, schedule/lodging, "our story", RSVP, gallery, (very simple) registry, discussion page.


I built this website in February of 2016. I need to clean up the scripts to make them a true template. Right now they are still geared towards our wedding. It worked great in organizing our wedding! The starry background with the total solar eclipse picture was gorgeous (we had our wedding near the eclipse and watched it with our guests the next morning). Note: the total solare eclipse pic was rendered in Blender (by my husband).
